    Description:
</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        A meatball is a small, ball-shaped or round portion of ground meat, typically made from beef, pork, veal, or a combination of meats. The meat is usually mixed with breadcrumbs, eggs, herbs, and seasonings to enhance flavor and texture. Meatballs can be cooked by frying, baking, steaming, or simmering in sauce.

<h2>
    Ingredients:
</h2>
    <ul>
       <li> 1 pound (450g) ground meat (beef, pork, veal, or a combination) </li>
       <li> 1/2 cup breadcrumbs </li>
       <li> 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese </li>
       <li> 2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
       <li> 1/4 cup fresh parsley, finely chopped </li>
       <li> 1 large egg </li>
       <li> 1/2 teaspoon salt </li>
       <li> 1/4 teaspoon black pepper </li>
       <li> 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano </li>
       <li> 1/4 cup milk (optional, for added moisture) </li>
    </ul>

    Steps:
</h2>
    <ol style="text-align: justify">
        <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>

          <br>

        <li>Prepare the Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground meat, breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan cheese, minced garlic, chopped parsley, egg, salt, pepper, and dried oregano. If you want your meatballs to be extra moist, you can add 1/4 cup of milk as well.</li>

        <br>

        <li>Mix the Ingredients: Use your hands to thoroughly mix all the ingredients until well combined. Make sure not to overmix, as this can make the meatballs dense.</li>

        <br>

        <li>Shape the Meatballs: Take small portions of the mixture and roll them between your palms to form small, evenly-sized meatballs. Aim for about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter.</li>

        <br>

        <li>Arrange on Baking Sheet: Place the shaped meatballs on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving some space between each.</li>

        <br>

        <li>Bake in the Oven: Bake the meatballs in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes or until they are cooked through and browned on the outside. You can also broil them for a couple of minutes at the end for a golden finish.</li>

        <br>

        <li>Serve: Once cooked, remove the meatballs from the oven. Serve them hot with your favorite sauce, pasta, or as desired.</li>
